        <p>
        For over 15 years I have developed high quality mobile applications, web applications, and APIs. I
        led teams in the finance, gaming, telecommunications, and consumer products
        industries. 
        </p>
        <p>
        I build software for two audiences: the customer, and my fellow
        engineers. I passionately design and implement reusable, extensible,
        and testable code in the form of deliverable libraries. This lets my
        team work faster&mdash;and safer&mdash;allowing us to solve customer
        problems, not engineering issues.
        </p>
        <p>
        I love to share my knowledge with others, especially people who are new
        to my team or to application engineering as a whole. Building a team of
        cross-discipline experts makes work&mdash;and the product&mdash;better.
